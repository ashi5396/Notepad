# Notepad
Notepad was a project that was done in one of the courses at Washington State University. I developed this project using C#. Notepad has the ability to load first 50 Fibonacci numbers and first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Furthermore, it supports functionalities such as saving a file and loading a file. I followed TDD approach for this project.
